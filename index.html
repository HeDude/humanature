						<div class="text"><small>Since then we planted numerous trees, shrubs and herbs. The plan is to have every layer of a forest (from the tallest tree to the smallest herb) filled with edible plants. 
							When we arrived, we started planting young trees that do well on clay soil and can survive a bit of drought. We planted sweet cherry, orange, plum and more. We are propagating multiple medicinal herbs such as lavender, citronmelisse and mint, to later plant in the forest. 
							We also want to focus on giving wildlife a place in the forest. For example, one of our ruins is covered in wild bramble, making it impossible for us to do anything with it. But after observing the ruin for a while we counted many birds living in this bramble bush. Therefor we decided to leave it as a bird shelter. 
							In the future we also want to have a greenhouse in the forest to support us with growing more tropical trees and to serve as a nursery for seedlings.</small></div>

							<div class="text"><small>The house is old and has been abandoned for many years. Just like our plan with the land, we want to revive the house. Bringing back a vibrant energy and restore what needs to be restored as natural as possible. 
								Living in an old house with many flaws asks for a resourceful approach. With all the problems we find we try to find a natural solution. Here you can read some examples.  
								The houses wastewater doesn’t end it a sewer, it ends in the food forest. This gives us a big challenge and an even bigger opportunity. The challenge is to limit the non-biodegradables which means washing with organic soap, not flushing toilet paper down the toilet, etc. The place where the water reaches the olive grove needs to be designed in a way that the soil and plants will filter the water. Thus, we are setting up a small rive. The river has small pools on every few meters to slow down the water and give a chance to the sediments to settle. The river is filled and surrounded by more and more plants that thrive in this environment and can feed on the nutrients we flush away. These plants are both foraged in surrounding area and replanted, but many of them also popped up on their own. It will take some time to test and perfect this solution, but once it proves to work it’s a great gift the house gave us. It’s an opportunity to not only repurpose all our water into irrigation for the trees, but also to let nutrients flow straight into the land. 
								Another problem we faced in the first winter were the many gaps in the house. The windows were not sealed well, the roof had some gaps (no leakages thankfully), and it was cold. Luckily the soil consists mostly of clay. We manually removed the rocks from the soil and used this abundance of clay, mixed with a little bit of sand, to tap the holes and unsalted the house.

								<h2>Volunteering</h2>
								<p class="description"><br/>We happily host volunteers and have been doing so from the start. There is a wide range of tasks to do so there will most likely be something you enjoy doing. Tasks can range from creating a wall painting and building an outdoor kitchen, to planting trees and harvesting olives. We also invite you to bring your own idea, your own project, something you’re passionate for to work on in the Quinta. We are open to a lot of things, as long as they are respectful towards human and nature.</p>
								<p class="description"><br/>We don’t have working hours as every person functions differently and most efficiently in it’s own way. That’s why we simply ask you to join our team and join in with the work, cooking, cleaning etc. when possible. The most important thing is that you feel happy and stress-free.</p>
								<p class="description"><br/>Here you will have your own room available with a single bed. The rest of the facilities will be shared. In the village there are some small supermarkets, a bar and a church. We have two bicycles for you to use. We are on walking distance from a river where, with good weather, you can swim. Furthermore, we are a 1-2 hour drive away from one of Portugal greatest natural parks: Serra da Estrela.</p>
								<p class="description"><br/>We invite you to bring a pair of good shoes and clothes to work on the land. In winter season we also strongly advice you to bring a warm jacket and rainboots as it can get very cold and wet. 
									Since we just started the project and don’t have an income, yet we ask a contribution of 30 euros a week to cover the costs for food, gas, electricity and water. In the future we hope this won’t be necessary anymore.</p>
								<p class="description"><br/>Send us an e-mail if you are interested, and we hope to see you soon!</p>

								<p class="description"><br/>We have a spot at the lower part of the land open for people who want to camp with their tents, cars, campervans or whatnot. As it is now there are no facilities but, in the future, we are planning on having electricity and a compost toilet. Nearby in the village there is a spring with mountain water which you can use to fill your water-tank.</p>
								<p class="description"><br/>Because of the lack of facilities, we ask you to be completely self-sufficient, unless you are also planning to volunteer (see the other category).</p>

An adoption only costs 5 euros a month. For this money we can feed, water and give love to your adopted creature. 
You will give them a name, and your chosen name will also appear on any potential products they produce. We will send you updates with pictures to keep your adopted animal or plant close to you. 
Every month you can decide if you want to keep up your adoption or if it’s time to say goodbye.
